            Holi is the marquee event for us in the Spring Semester. The
            festival of colors is celebrated as grand as it is celebrated back
            in India and is enjoyed by people from every part of the world. You
            will get to adorn with colors and water while we’ll have a DJ
            playing some Bollywood and Western music in the background. The
            festival is enhanced by serving a full Indian meal to make sure they
            experience and savour rich Indian delicacies. We have been having an
            attendance of 1200 for this event for the past few years. This the
            event you cannot afford to miss.

            <p>
              Bollywood Night is an ice-breaker event for the students arrived
              here for the Spring semester. There would be interesting
              activities at the beginning of the event to promote the Indian
              Film Industry and we will have music from a Live DJ playing
              Bollywood and English songs as the dance floor would be opened to
              people to groove and show some moves. In this way, students can
              interact with new people and get to know more about their cultures
              which ASU focuses on. Food would be served as well to make sure
              that the attendees go home with a full stomach. This is because
              the end time of the event is almost dinner time and after losing a
              lot of calories due to dancing, the attendees would surely look to
              hog on some delicious pizzas. It will truly be a fun filled event
              for every student involved as they dance, sing and click photos
              with their friends as well as make new friends all through the
              night.

            the day as well the celebrations that are held on the day. The day
            would involve unfolding of the Indian tricolor followed by a musical
            performance by some of the students. Also, we would have a screening
            of the parade held at New Delhi, India which portrays the different
            regions of India as well as the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force. In
            this way, we let everyone know more about India, the culture and the
            people.

              captivates and binds the diverse student culture and showcases the
              best talents of ASU. The event will be filled with dance
              performances of different styles, music of various genres, mad
              ads, stand up comedy and many more. To end the event at a higher
              note, there are a variety of fun games and Indian food for
              everyone to enjoy.
